    <h2> 1 Git and GitHub </h2>
    <p>In this section what is Git and GitHub will be explained.</p>


    <p><b>Git</b> is a free an open source distributed version control system. It was originally developed 
      by Linus Tovvalds<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[1]</a></sup> to manage changes to the Linux kernel.<br/>
    <b>GitHub</b> is an online service that uses Git to provide code repositories. 
      GitHub has added functionality in comparison, and is one of the most popular code repository systems worldwide.<br/>
    In other words Github is a platform that helps people solve different problems by building software together.</p>
    
    <p>As it is seen in the picture below in any repository there is the main/master branch. This code could be anything from software in ATMs, to Game development, to farming.<br/>
      In order to solve issues, bugs, or even upgrade features of software; changes in the main code need to happen. However, it would not be efficient if a team of developers <br/> 
      started updating and testing new features in the main code. This is be because the main code could activelly be connected to multiple platforms and a small change could <br/> 
      lead to a catastrophic failure of the whole system.</p>
    <p id="workflow"><u>So the solution to that is version control!!</u><br/>
      With this version control, branches are created from the main branch of the code. With this the users can now add new code, and test features without altering the main.<br/>
      When changes are made on that branch the users can commit those changes to the branch/branches (multiple commits can happen). <br/>
      Once the user/users feel that the changes are ready to be reviewed, then a pull request can be made. With this the team can now see the changes, review them and discuss, and ultimetly<br/>
      merge the new code to the main. Useful link to understand what Git is can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&ab_channel=GitHub">here</a>.</p>
    <p><i>The picture below represents the main steps of the GitHub workflow:</i></p>

    <h3 id="term">Key termilogy in understanding Git and GitHub:</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Repository</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the container of all code</dd>
      <dt><b>Branch</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the separate working area for code under development</dd>
      <dt><b>Clone</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the connected copy of the repository locally</dd>
      <dt><b>Fork</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the copy of the repository locally</dd>
      <dt><b>Commit</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the addition of the code to the branch</dd>
      <dt><b>Pull</b></dt>
      <dd>Publish the committed changes to the repository to review and eventually merge</dd>
      <dt><b>Merge</b></dt>
      <dd>Is the merging from a branch into another</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>It is worth noting that you can work with repositories online, but also locally. The preferred way is to work on a repository locally and use the internet connection <br/>
      for clone, fork, fetch, pull, and merge.</p>
    <p id="ways">There are <b>4</b> main ways in creating and working with repositories</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Through the GitHub online interface</li>
      <li>Through terminals</li>
      <li>Through IDEs</li>
      <li>A combination of the above</li>

      <h2 id="unix">2 Unix Shell</h2>
      <p>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.<br/> 
        The shell is both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system 
        using shell scripts.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">[2]</a></sup><br/>
        In the shell it is less obvious how to perform tasks but allows powerful automation and is useful for any programmer in managing files and automating basic tasks.<br/>
        The shell used below is GitBash. You can see from the picture below that the UI is a black box, where the user can input commands to control the operating system.</p>
        <img src="pictures/gitbash_ui.PNG" alt="User Interface of GitBash">
      <p>The syntax of the scripting language follows the following <b>Command   Flag/Option/Switch   Argument</b>.<br/></p> 
      <p>One of the basic commands is the <code>ls</code>, which is used to list the files in the directory. Using the <code>ls -a</code> all files are listed, including the hidden items.<br/>
        In order to show the directory the user is at the <code>pwd</code> command is used, whereas to change directory it is
        <code>cd <i>foldername</i></code></p><br/>
      <p>To create new directory is <code>mkdir <i>directoryname</i></code>. To create new file is <code>touch <i>name.extension</i></code> and to delete a file is 
        <code>rm <i>name.extension</i></code> </p>
      <p>In order to understand directories better, the picture below depicts an example root directory structure. The shell starts at the root directory and when using the <code>cd</code><br/>
        command it goes one layer down. So is for example you are at the work folder and want to go to carol folder, then you can use <code>cd ..</code>.
        The <code>..</code> represents one folder above.<br/> 
        If you wanted to go two folders above then <code>cd ../..</code> would be used. This is a fast way to work your way through different folders without having to type the whole<br/>
         path all the time</p>
        <p>For example used above:<img src="pictures/root.png" alt="Example root directory structure"></p>
        <h3 id="commands">Useful shell commands:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><code>ls</code> or <code>ls -a</code> , lists files in a directory</li>
          <li><code>pwd</code> print working directory</li>
          <li><code>cd </code> or <code>cd ..</code> , change directory</li>
          <li><code>mkdir <i>directoryname</i></code> create a new directory</li>
          <li><code>touch <i>filename.extension</i></code> create new file</li>
          <li><code>rm <i>filename.extension</i></code> deletes file, and <code>rm -r <i>directoryname</i></code> deletes a directory</li>
          <li><i>Some useful flags <code>--help</code> , provides manual of command used <code>-i</code> , usually used with <code>rm</code> to be asked if you want to delete</i></li>
        </ul>
